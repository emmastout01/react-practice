# React Practice

## Notes on React 

- React is set up to pay attention to the code that you're modifying in the src folder. If you make a change to something in the src folder the DOM will refresh and instantly/automatically update with that change.
- React creates a local development server just for the client-side code. So, when we run 'npm start' or 'yarn start' on a client-side React project, we're not pulling up server files like we would for other JS projects. 
- React allows us to write HTML inside of our JS files using JSX. 

## Notes on React-Related things:

- We use Babel to compile the ES6 code into ES5 (it allows us to write in ES6, but have the code work on all browsers)
